block size of the audio you send to the other site. Click "2X" to send
each outgoing packet twice (this doubles the data rate but might give
fewer dropped packets).;
#X text 436 208 If the "calling" button is flashing we're either waiting
for a response from the server \, or from the peer. Once both of these
arrive the "connected" toggle turns on (gets an "x" mark.) At this
point a call is in progress and the "packets in" counter should be
changing. Press the "reset" button to set packet and drop counts back
to zero.;

#X text 440 8 This is a Pure Data patch allowing musicians (or others)
to make point-to-point \, uncompressed \, low-latency audio connections
\, through home routers. It's best if you can run an ethernet cable
from your computer to your router \, but this will work over "wifi"
(wireless networks) too.;
#X text 436 94 To make a call \, enter a unique "call name" (click
on the text area that says "this-call-name" and type in a new name)
\, then click "ON/OFF so that an "X" appears. When someone else makes
a call with the same name \, quacktrip should connect you together
in a call. A public "conniption" server (by default foo.ucsd.edu) helps
make the connection \, but the audio runs straight between the two
computers.;
#X text 434 306 The input delay can be set to absorb network time variations
(in units of 64 samples). The "fill" range shows how far ahead of the
incoming stream we are. If the lower number drops below 2 there will
be a dropout in the audio output.;
#X text 433 491 IN and OUT panels: the "level" control is 50 for unit
gain \, 100 for +24 dB. Meters are post-fader. The "test" button sends
sine tones (660 and 880 Hz) \, also affected by the level control.
"Input monitor" loops your input to your own output \, with optional
delay in milliseconds \, so you can hear yourself in sync with the
other caller.;
